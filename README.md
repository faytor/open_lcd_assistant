## General Info
***
I have been looking for a tool to convert bitmap images into byte arrays that can be used in monochrom OLED or LCD displays. The best known tool I found to perform this task is [LCD Assistant](http://en.radzio.dxp.pl/bitmap_converter/) but it works only on Windows. So I had to write something similar that can be used in MacOS, Linux or even Windows. You can gess whay I called it Open LCD Assistant :)


## Usage
***

- `(1)` Load the BMP image
- `(2)` Preview of the loaded image
- `(3)` Choose the conversion method
- `(4)` Convert the image into bitmap array
- `(5)` The generated byte array (can be copied to your arduino code)
- `(6)` To save the byte array to .txt file

## Dependency
***
To make the script work, you must install the following modules:

Pillow, for  image manipulation module:
```
pip install Pillow
```
PyQt5, a framework for gui development
```
pip install PyQt5
```
NumPy package for array computing
```
pip install numpy
```

Or, more simply by using the following command, all the dependencies will be installed automatically
```
pip install requirements.txt
```

## Test
***
The program has been tested in Horizontal mode and only with u8g2 library

- Software 
    * [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
    * [u8g2 Library](https://github.com/olikraus/u8g2/wiki)
- Hardware
    * [Heltec WiFi LoRa 32(V2)](https://heltec.org/project/wifi-lora-32/)

- Test code
    * Use the arduino code [arduino_ug82_code](./arduino_ug82_code/arduino_ug82_code.ino) example

- Test result

## Todo
***
- Add a Checkbox to give the user the possibility to invert the image colors
- Generate dmg and exe files
